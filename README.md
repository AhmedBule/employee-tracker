## Usage: 
Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.


Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.


Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
